    <p>The immerse growth of the modern civilization over the last two centuries was mainly due to the discovery of 
        electricity and has been the driving force in the birth of modern civilization and has been said to be the 
        lifeblood of the modern world. Electrical machines and appliances naturally were produced as electricity was 
        discovered could be used to solve a lot of human problems today. These machines have found applications ranging 
        from power generation, control systems, medical applications, comfort and entertainment etc, and virtually in all 
        human endeavors. This is made possible by electric power and we are all dependent on it. Advancement in technological 
        growth has resulted in the production of portable power generating sets to suit our varied needs and other alternative 
        means of power generation are being discovered through researches other than the turbine-alternator approach [Mark A.B, 2005].
        Each countrys Government have established power utility companies that handle the bulk of power generation, 
        sometimes with distribution because of the huge cost of operation involved so as to insure the welfare of its
        citizenry need for electricity supply and economic growth as failure, inadequacy or incompetence sometimes could 
        affect our comfort, work and even life so much that there is this rush for people to have a means of getting constant power
